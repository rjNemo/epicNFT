## ðŸ”® Taking your project further!

What you learned in this project is just the beginning! There is so much more you can do with NFTs and smart contracts, here's a few examples you can research further âœ¨

- Sell your NFTs - Right now your users only have to pay gas fees to mint your awesome nfts and you're not getting any of that money! There are several ways to alter your smart contract that make the user pay you to mint your transactions, such as adding payable to your contract and using require to set a minimum amount. Since you're dealing with real money here it's best to do your research carefully and ask the experts that your code is safe. OpenZeppelin has a forum where you can ask questions like this one [here!](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/implementation-of-sellable-nft/5517/)
- Add Royalties - You can also add royalties to your smart contract that would give you a percentage of every future sale of your NFT! Read more about it here: [EIP-2981: NFT Royalty Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981)
- Test your contracts locally - If you want to test your contracts more extensively without deploying to a test net like Rinkeby, Hardhat of course will let you do that! Best way to achieve that is to open up a separate terminal window, navigate to your project directory, then run npx hardhat node and keep that window open! Just like in the beginning of the project you'll see a bunch of accounts with lots of ether. In your other terminal window you can run your test scripts and watch it affect your node window!
